// MARK: - Keeping the call's engines in sync

/// The call always uses the engines the user chose — within what the app's
/// state allows:
/// - **Background**: on-device (GPU) models can't run, so the voice moves to
///   the server (system voice as a per-sentence safety net) and listening
///   moves to the server / Apple Speech.
/// - **Foreground again**: the chosen on-device models are reloaded and
///   swapped back in once ready; the stand-ins keep talking meanwhile.
/// - **Settings changed mid-call** (Settings or the in-call Voice sheet):
///   applied right away — a new voice speaks from the next sentence, a new
///   listening engine takes over without losing what the user is saying.
